I'm an applied biostatistician, working as a consultant and trainer [at EMBL](https://www.embl.org/people/person/sarah-kaspar/), where I run the [Centre for Statistical Data Analysis](https://bio-it.embl.de/centres/csda/).

I'm trained as a biologist and bioinformatician, and have worked in the following areas:

- Statistical models 
- kinetic models 
- data wrangling and visualization 
- analyzing transcriptomics and other omics data 
- image analysis 
- microbiology 
- machine learning 

I'm dedicated to communicating science clearly, [teaching](/about/teaching), and providing open-source training materials.
